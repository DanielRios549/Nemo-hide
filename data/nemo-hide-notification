Name: Nemo Hide Extension requires restarting Nemo
Priority: High
Terminal: False
DontShowAfterReboot: True
DisplayIf: pgrep nemo
Description: Nemo Hide Extension has been installed. Restart of Nemo is needed to make it work properly (hint: 'nemo -q' in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. After restart, a new option will emerge in Nemo context menu. This option lets you hide selected files or folders without renaming them (no extra '.' or '~' added).
